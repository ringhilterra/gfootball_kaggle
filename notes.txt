-we want to keep container running in background, so just detech, not kill container every time?

TO DOs
- setup jupyter
- figure out log files and output of running episodes? (want to be able to run a lot of agents against each other and record scores?)
-understand different actions beter
-pull different episode runs from kaggle

Questions
- where does default dump file get written out to when save_video not video set? Is it even possible to generate without save_video?

NOTEs

- run 'python3 agent_play.py' to play 2 agents against each other

- run 'docker ps -a -q --filter=ancestor=gfootball_kaggle | xargs -I {} docker rm {}'  to cleanup killed docker containers

- run 'jupyter notebook --ip 0.0.0.0 --no-browser --allow-root' to launch jupyter lab, then on local machine go to http://localhost/8080

- to dump file txt use "python3 dump_to_txt.py --trace_file /fmountgf/video_replays/dabb0e4d-3dd6-4475-8c91-43578b4d09da/episode_done_20201008-065306795426.dump --output /fmountgf/test/blah.txt"

- to dump file to video use "python3 dump_to_video.py --trace_file /fmountgf/video_replays/dabb0e4d-3dd6-4475-8c91-43578b4d09da/episode_done_20201008-065306795426.dump (weird that it)

- episode_scraping/scrape_episodes.py , set variables you want in that file to scrape specific team and submission_id data
